### 🥅  Goals 
✔️ Get and display the default sample data on the gauge <br />
✔️ Get and display the random data on the gauge <br />
✔️ Update the values with the conditions(e.g.number type only, mix and value can not be bigger than max)  <br />
✔️ Calculate gauge display range and percentage by the values <br />
✔️ Unit test (when input changes...) 

### 🥅  what I would have done next with more time
✔️ Drag and Drop the gauge range and update the values <br />
✔️ Change the currency automatically with external currency API <br />
✔️ Take more test driven approach <br />
